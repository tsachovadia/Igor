# Project Brief: Igor - The Personal AI Assistant

## Vision

Igor is a personalized AI-powered assistant designed to streamline and centralize control over various digital aspects of life. It will act as a central hub, accessible via a simple chat or command-line interface, providing the ability to interact with and manage critical services like Notion, local machine files, calendars, emails, and eventually, WhatsApp.

The core philosophy is not just to integrate these services, but to create a data-centric ecosystem. For each integrated service, Igor will extract, structure, and store the relevant data. This data will then be analyzed by AI models to provide insights, automate tasks, and create a deeply personalized and context-aware assistant.

## Key Features

1.  **Unified Interface:** A single point of interaction (initially a CLI) to manage all connected services.
2.  **Service Integration:**
    *   **Notion:** Full read/write access to the "Second Brain."
    *   **Local Machine:** File system operations and script execution.
    *   **Calendars:** Read and manage events.
    *   **Emails:** Read, analyze, and potentially draft emails.
    *   **WhatsApp (Advanced Goal):** Wrap the personal WhatsApp for AI-powered interaction.
3.  **Data Extraction & Analysis:** For each service, build a local database from its data (e.g., all emails, all WhatsApp messages).
4.  **AI-Powered Insights:** Use LLMs to analyze the structured data, understand patterns, and provide actionable insights.
